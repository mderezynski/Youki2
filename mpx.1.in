Start BMPx in "offline" mode, that is, don't enable network dependent sources (Last.fm, Radios), and don't use network dependent services (Musicbrainz)
.TP
.B \-u, \-\-uris
Parse the command line arguments as URIs to play (this is the default anyway so this option shouldn't be really needed; legacy reasons)

.B \-f, \-\-files
By default, beep-media-player-2 will expect the arguments passed to it on the commandline without options to be URIs (e.g. file:///music/file.ogg, or http://somehost.com/stream.ogg); using this switch will make it treat the arguments as filenames of locally (on this host) acecssible files instead
