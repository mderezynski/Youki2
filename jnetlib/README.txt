II)  Introduction

Welcome to the JNetLib library, a C++ asynchronous network abstraction layer.

III) Features

* Works under Linux, FreeBSD, Win32, and other operating systems.
* TCP connections support
* Listening sockets support
* Asynchronous DNS support
* HTTP serving and getting support (including basic authentication, GET/POST and HTTP/1.1 support)
* Basic HTTPS serving, getting support (including basic authentication, and HTTP/1.1 support)
* Completely asynchronous love for single threaded apps.
* Coming soon: support for UDP, as well as serial i/o. 

IV)  SSL Integration

JNetLib now employs the OpenSSL encryption library from www.openssl.org.
However, it is not compiled in as the default.
If you would like to have SSL support compiled in you have to:
1)  uncomment the #define _JNETLIB_SSL_ 1 in netinc.h
2)  Obtain the openssl requisite libraries libeay32.lib and ssleay32.lib
2a) You can obtain these libraries either by building them yourself via aquring the source yourself or...
2b) Download the SSL quickpack for windows, and ensure that you have the SSL quickpack in your build environment
You will need the proper include and library paths.
If you downloaded the quickpack to C:\, then the appropriate build environment include directory would be "c:\openssl\include", and so forth.

Disclaimer:
SSL functionality is new, and not entirely feature complete.
The current certification authentication tactic is to allow all certificates through, without checking any CA signatures.
